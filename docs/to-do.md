If current route path is dashboardPage then we do not need to display
header and footer of home page. We need to display header and footer of 
dashboard page

//acess the current path of react-router in App Component

//if current path is dashboard 

 //then display the dashboard header and footer
 
// else display the home header and footer 
 

```
